# 724-Final-Wine-Quality
The dataset "wine quality" contains physicochemical measurements of a sample of red and white wines from northern Portugal.
It is downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The original response "quality" is integer-valued, from 1 to 10.
We will reduce the response classes to three: Bad(quality<5), Average(quality between 5 and 6 inclusive), Good(quality > 6), and fit several different classifiers to the data. The number of "Bad" observations in the sample are relatively small and I was mainly interested to see if any of the models would be able to correctly classify any of these.
